<h2>Mali Show CANCELLED!</h2>



<p>



Wow, we're really sorry about this one but it's not our fault. We know it was supposed to be a 
secret awesome and dangerous underground show but there was nothing we could do to save it. 
Our amplifiers are too big and the Mali authorities told us they would only let us play the border
but not actually inside the country. We said, "Fuck that!". 
 </p>
<p>So we'd like to say SORRY to Western Africa! Maybe we can get in to Burkina Faso or Cote D'Ivoire or something. Stay tuned!</p>


<h2>Studio Jam</h2>

Check it out. This is us in "the dungeon" working on an upcoming song called Peace
Meal? (I don't think so!):<br/>

<h2>Mali Show</h2>

We're going to play a secret show in Mali so tell all your friends. This
will be our first fucking time in western Africa so we're fucking excited!


<h2>Norway Show</h2>

We have a sold out show in Norway next week. Even though it's sold out we
wanted to let you know how excited we are to be playing Norway for the 9th
time. We feel fucking blessed.


<h2>The Olympics are death and blood</h2>
<p>
Well, it's olympic season so the only thing all those boring fucking lively
people are talking about is the Olympics and Taiwan. But don't worry, Metalbaum
is here to bring you some hard fucking death metal fucking good times
fucking ya! Stay tuned for more of our fucking heavy shit.
